# Dice-Game

This game shows how to select and manipulate elements in our website on the fly using the DOM and JavaScript.
It's a paint with a h1 with a title that says Refresh Me, and then it's got Player 1 dice and
Player 2 dice.
And when we refresh our website then our dice get thrown randomly, so that player 1 and player 2
both have their dice values, and our website will announce a winner depending on whose dice value
was higher.

## The main features of this website are:

1. Random generation in Javascript
2. Control Statements: Using If-Else Conditional & Logic
3. Selecting and Manipulating DOM(Document Object Model) with JavaScript
